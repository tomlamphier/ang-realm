Sendgrid Email Relay
--------------------

I have an account on sendgrid for emailing the verification code for a 
new user. The program main.go on my AWS newindigommt.com runs a server 
off port 5000. The Angular app sends a request to this program, which 
gets forwarded to sendgrid. All this is being done to keep my API key
for sendgrid out of sight. 

When running the go program, first source sendgrid.env--this puts the 
API key into the environment where the program can pick it up. 
Note: sendgrid.env is on the newindigommt.com site. I can't add it to this repo
without making it public and opening access to my sendgrid account.
